my beautiful tubes is a plugin which allows you to post video on your content in different positions.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to insert youtube video into your post at any of these four positions (top-left,bottom-right,top-right,bottom-left).
No short code requires, just insert your youtube video share link, for example http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Qj9J1zb7Y into the 'Tube URL' text box under
'Enter the Youtube Video Share Link' which is located under the right-hand-side-bar of wordpress edit post panel. Everytime you write a new post
and decided to insert youtube video into that post, all you need to do is to insert the youtube video share link plus select the position of your video
from the select box and this video will be published together with your new post! If you want to take out that video later on, then all you need is just to
leave the 'Tube URL' text box blank when you edit your post, after you have updated your post, the video will no longer be there, just that simple.
